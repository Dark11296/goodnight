# TO-DO
* Add freeze/pan transitions between screens a la Mega Man 2.
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design a lot more levels!
* Create Electron app.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.
* Add a pause screen with stats. Also show at end of game.
* Need to ensure gamepad users know there is a chill button. Maybe show controls somewhere in-game.
* The chain climbable area needs to be bigger or go down further? A player was clearly touching it but it was not grabbing on the player didn't know what to do.

### Pause screen stats:
* Current level number
* Seconds chilled
* Znakes murdered
* Times killed
* Gorge-jumping record (max consecutive times jumped level 5 gorge without falling in)
* Flowers collected

# KNOWN BUGS
* Float animation is way too fast.
* Znakes will walk through walls.
* There is some weirdness with gamepad support. Sometimes keyboard keys or gamepad buttons/sticks stop working.
