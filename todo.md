# TO-DO
* Add freeze/pan transitions between screens a la Mega Man 2.
* Finish opening & add closing cutscene.
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design all the levels!
* Add end credits.

# KNOWN BUGS
* When skipping text animation in intro, sometimes characters duplicate.
* When forcing blank characters during text animation in intro, text SFX still plays.
* Float animation is way too fast.
