# TO-DO
* Add a layer of tiles for climbable areas. Apply to chain so player can climb on top of it instead of beside it. Once player touches chain, they should stop falling but still be able to move up/down/left/right.
* Add a layer of tiles for water. Push player to the surface (like you're doing at the bottom of level 1).
