# TO-DO
* Replace placeholder music & SFX. Add pause/unpause SFX.
* Design more levels!
* Get the player to go up the chain all the way off the screen before the transition starts (or during the transition).
* Try setting up Mario-style swimming physics instead of the buoyancy that's there now.
* Try splitting NPC lines into two lines and using 8x8 font.
* Create Electron app.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.
* Show stats screen at the end of the game.
* Need to ensure gamepad users know there is a chill button. Maybe show controls somewhere in-game. (Or have subconscious talk about it.)
* Release on Steam.
* Port to Switch.

## ACHIEVEMENTS
* Zero Chill: Finish the game with a 0-second chill record.
* Stop & Smell: Pick every flower in the game.
* Exterminator/Ruthlezz/Cold-Blooded: Kill every znake in the game. (Except the impossible ones.)
* Deathproof: Never die. "If you die in your dreams, do you die in real life? You'll never know."
* Knievel: Jump the gorge 20 times without dying.
* Greatnight: Qualify for Zero Chill, Stop & Smell, Cold-Blooded, Deathproof, and Knievel achievements in a single run.
* Allergic: Avoid all the flowers.
* Pazifizt: Don't kill any snakes.

# KNOWN BUGS
* Title screen music goes silent for a bit after it has looped a couple of times.
* After adding transitions, player doesn't have to come back to pick up the first flower in level 2.
* Float animation is way too fast.
* Znakes will walk through walls.
* There is some weirdness with gamepad support. Sometimes keyboard keys or gamepad buttons/sticks stop working. (This may be fixed. Keep an eye out.)
* Weirdly, using the joystick on Xbone controller on level 5 to get to the water pool to transition to znake lair works, but using the D-pad doesn't seem to give you enough gas to get over there.
