# TO-DO
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design more levels!
* Create Electron app.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.
* Show stats screen at the end of the game.
* Need to ensure gamepad users know there is a chill button. Maybe show controls somewhere in-game. (Or have subconscious talk about it.)
* Release on Steam.
* Port to Switch.

## ACHIEVEMENTS
* Zero chill: Finish the game with a 0-second chill record.
* Stop & Smell: Pick every flower in the game.
* Exterminator: Kill every znake in the game. (Except the impossible ones.)
* Deathproof: Never die. "If you die in your dreams, do you die in real life? You'll never know."
* Knievel: Jump the gorge 20 times without dying.
* Greatnight: Qualify for all other achievements in a single run.
* Avoid all the flowers. (Would mean tweaking wording on Greatnight.)

# KNOWN BUGS
* Float animation is way too fast.
* Znakes will walk through walls.
* There is some weirdness with gamepad support. Sometimes keyboard keys or gamepad buttons/sticks stop working.
* Sometimes pausing the game fails to hide the level scene. Sometimes scene change calls (startNextLevel or pause) are spammed.
