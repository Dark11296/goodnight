# TO-DO
* Block input while player is blinking at start of level.
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design a lot more levels!
* Create Electron app.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.
* Add a pause screen with stats. Also show at end of game.
* Need to ensure gamepad users know there is a chill button. Maybe show controls somewhere in-game. (Or have subconscious talk about it.)
* Release on Steam.
* Port to Switch.

# KNOWN BUGS
* Float animation is way too fast.
* Znakes will walk through walls.
* There is some weirdness with gamepad support. Sometimes keyboard keys or gamepad buttons/sticks stop working.
