# TO-DO
* Add freeze/pan transitions between screens a la Mega Man 2.
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design a lot more levels!
* Add gamepad controls.
* Create Electron app.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.
* Add a pause screen with stats. Also show at end of game.

### Pause screen stats:

* Times killed
* Pond-jumping record (max consecutive times jumped level 5 pond without falling in)
* Flowers collected

# KNOWN BUGS
* Float animation is way too fast.
* Znakes will walk through walls.
