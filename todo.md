## ACHIEVEMENTS

# KNOWN BUGS
* Sinking makes it possible to clip into the lower right platform on level 6.
* Title screen music goes silent for a bit after it has looped a couple of times.
* After adding transitions, player doesn't have to come back to pick up the first flower in level 2.
* If you put walls in front of znakes, they will walk through them (so I don't).
* There is some weirdness with gamepad support. Sometimes keyboard keys or gamepad buttons/sticks stop working.
* Sometimes the player animation glitches when climbing at the top of the chain.
* For some reason on itch.io there is weird spacing on some of the opening cutscene paragraphs.
