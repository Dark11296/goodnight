# TO-DO
* Add freeze/pan transitions between screens a la Mega Man 2.
* Replace placeholder music & SFX.
* Design a lot more levels!
* Add gamepad controls.
* Create Electron app.
* Add a pause screen. Show seconds chilled, znakes murdered, times killed, and flowers collected. Also show at end of game.
* Remove all the .DS_Store files from the repo.

# KNOWN BUGS
* Float animation is way too fast.
